## Introduction

The Simple Shell is a basic command-line interpreter written in C. It provides a simplified interface for users to interact with the operating system. This project aims to demonstrate the fundamentals of shell programming and serve as a starting point for further development.

## Features

- Executes basic shell commands
- Supports command line arguments and options
- Handles input/output redirection
- Implements basic shell built-in commands
- Provides a simple prompt for user interaction

## Installation

To install and run the Simple Shell, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kamurano/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd holbertonschool-simple_shell
3. Compile the source code: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o simpleShell`
4. Run the shell: `./simpleShell`

## Usage

Once the shell is running, you can enter commands just like in a regular terminal. Here are a few examples:

- `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory
- `exit`: Exit the shell

For more information on available commands and options, refer to the [man page](man/simple-shell.1).
